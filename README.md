My project is a website that dispalys about the Black Lives Matter movement. I created it in Django a python web frameworks that allows for easy web development, for example I only made one html file for each page instwad of one for each object. Django allowed me to create exactly what I wanted. Mext I want to be able to create a Virtual Assitant web site that can control your hone from anywhere.
